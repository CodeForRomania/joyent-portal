Adding plotly through npm and created a plotly graph components
Running three different graph types of the same data on the same page

## summary

Pros: 
 - [x] simple and complete api for static graphs

Cons:
 - [ ] very slow on consecutive renders (if they happen in short intervals)
 - [ ] lacking api for real time graphs
 - [ ] `restyle` or `recalc` are only useful for style changes
 - [ ] `extendTraces` API is not documented and not obvious

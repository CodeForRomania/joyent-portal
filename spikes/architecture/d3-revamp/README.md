# D3 graph layouts

D3 v4, has a nice force directed graph set of features, that allows you to implement features in the graph with ease. By just manipulating the nodes using svg attributes and css.
This with the addition that D3 is a very well respected and widely used toolkit, makes finding documentation and developer speed a breeze.

It does seem to slow down on larger nodes, but this is mainly due to the built in force directed animation, disabling this, or computing this in a web-worker can speed up things considerably.

As a developer I found my self more productive with the API that d3 exposes, and was able to accomplish more in the same time as other frameworks.

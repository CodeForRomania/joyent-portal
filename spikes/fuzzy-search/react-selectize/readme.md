# react-fuzzy-filter

- https://github.com/jdlehman/react-fuzzy-filter

- Does not use API endpoint, instead an array of objects needs to be created locally
- Hard to style - or didn't come easily straight out of the box
- Reqiures adding `react-addons-css-transition-group` and `react-addons-shallow-compare`

The Joyent UI Toolkit allows anyone designing and building new
[Joyent](https://www.joyent.com/) cloud products to rapidly create designs and
prototypes that follow a considered and consistent design direction.

As any style guide and design system, this toolkit is a work in progress, and
everyone is encouraged to
[contribute and improve it](https://github.com/yldio/joyent-portal/tree/master/packages/ui-toolkit).
